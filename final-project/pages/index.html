         <p> a huge paragrah I’m passionate about creating engaging websites for business owners and entrepreneurs and take a keen personal interest in each of my clients. 

I’ve been designing websites for over 10 years and a business owner for over 13 years. Prior to this I worked for a large multi-national company for over 20 years so I bring a blend of corporate experience and being a small business owner to understanding my clients’ businesses.

When I’m not designing websites I love to create kitchen magic, trying new dishes and exotic ingredients. My first job was in the kitchen of a hotel and my love of cooking has grown since.</p>
